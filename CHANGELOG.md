# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.1.59

### Changed

- relaxed the pre-`/cook` ordinary-chat boundary so the primary agent can keep discussing and refining requirements before explicit `/cook` instead of switching into a hard handoff-only refusal mode as soon as workflow-worthiness is detected
- kept `/cook` as the only explicit workflow boundary, while teaching the pre-`/cook` prompt surfaces to recommend `/cook` advisory-first and only emit implementation-ready capsules once the first bounded slice is concrete enough
- made fresh explicit `/cook` handoffs reusable from recent ordinary-chat discussion instead of requiring the immediately preceding turn, so Cancel can return users cleanly to ordinary discussion before they rerun `/cook`
- kept bare `/cook` startup and done-workflow next-round entry fail-closed on missing or non-startable explicit handoffs, while active workflows still resume from canonical `.agent/**` state unless a fresh explicit handoff proposes replacement
- updated public parity and shipped package contents so the tracked `.agent` contract files are included in package tarballs and packaged smoke/release verification can scaffold canonical state truthfully

## 0.1.58

### Changed

- tightened implementation-ready explicit `/cook` handoffs so fresh capsules must already carry a bounded first slice, repo-change-oriented acceptance, implementation surfaces, verification commands, and why-that-slice-first structure before workflow startup
- made fresh explicit but non-startable `/cook` handoffs fail closed with a dedicated operator message instead of falling back to broader recent discussion or silently drifting into planning
- expanded regressions and public parity so valid, vague, stale, done-workflow, and negative explicit-handoff cases stay truthful across runtime behavior, docs, and `npm run release-check`

## 0.1.57

### Changed

- made explicit primary-agent `/cook` handoff the preferred startup-intake path by teaching ordinary-chat handoff turns to emit a structured `cook_handoff` capsule and letting `/cook` prefer that capsule over broad context re-inference when it is fresh, valid, and implementation-startable
- tightened implementation-ready explicit handoffs so the structured capsule must already carry a bounded `first_slice_goal`, repo-change-oriented acceptance, `implementation_surfaces`, `verification_commands`, and `why_this_slice_first` before `/cook` will start workflow from it
- kept the pre-`/cook` handoff capsule as advisory startup intake only, not canonical `.agent/**` workflow state, while still using context-derived startup as the fallback only when no fresh explicit handoff is blocking startup
- kept context-derived startup as a fallback only when there is no fresh explicit handoff blocking startup, so stale or invalidated capsules can still fall back to recent discussion while fresh non-startable handoffs fail closed instead of silently rewriting canonical state
- made finished-workflow suppression stay a safety layer instead of a replacement mission when a fresh explicit `/cook` handoff exists, and blocked negative rejection/suppression text from becoming a Startable startup mission
- removed inline `/cook` arguments from the shipped entry path again so explicit bare `/cook` is the only public command, and fail closed when recent discussion is insufficient or unreliable
- added a pre-`/cook` ordinary-chat handoff boundary so the primary agent is instructed to stop at `/cook` once a task has matured into completion-workflow scope instead of starting long-running implementation directly in ordinary chat

## 0.1.54

### Changed

- removed workflow-aware prompt interception so only explicit `/cook` or `/cook <hint>` enters the workflow; ordinary prompts now always stay on the main chat path
- updated docs and release checks to describe explicit `/cook` entry instead of router-managed natural-language takeover

## 0.1.53

### Changed

- removed assist mode from public routing behavior so natural-language entry is now either off or router, and made router the default trigger mode while keeping `/cook` as the canonical workflow boundary
- removed obsolete cook planning docs that no longer match the shipped router-only workflow entry behavior

## 0.1.52

### Changed

- updated README/help/release parity copy to describe the shipped `off` / `assist` / `router` natural-language routing behavior truthfully while keeping `/cook` as the canonical confirm-first workflow boundary and manual fallback
- documented the explicit router-mode **Send as normal chat** recovery path as a user choice, not as a silent downgrade, and kept public copy scoped to currently shipped router behavior rather than future auto-mode plans
- made `npm run release-check` fail closed on the shipped workflow-aware router docs/help contract while continuing to rerun `bash ./scripts/cook-trigger-routing-test.sh` alongside the existing `/cook` smoke/refocus/context regressions

## 0.1.51

### Added

- shipped assist-mode natural-language handoff that can offer to route `開始做`, `開始實作`, or `go ahead` style execution handoffs into the canonical `/cook` flow before the primary agent starts implementation work, while keeping `/cook` as the explicit workflow boundary and approval gate
- added `bash ./scripts/cook-trigger-routing-test.sh` to `npm run release-check` so packaged release parity now covers the natural-language takeover path alongside the existing `/cook` startup/refocus/context regressions

### Changed

- streamlined the README into a more user-facing guide with a 30-second quick start, common actions table, clearer natural-language handoff expectations, and shorter `/cook` usage explanations

## 0.1.50

### Changed

- simplified the README opening so people can tell at a glance whether this extension helps with their workflow, while preserving the existing `/cook` behavior and release-parity guidance

## 0.1.49

### Changed

- restored optional `/cook <hint>` support as a soft intent hint that biases context analysis, proposal ranking, active-workflow disambiguation, and next-round startup without bypassing fail-closed routing or the approval-only Start/Cancel gate

## 0.1.48

### Fixed

- stopped injecting active completion workflow routing into ordinary non-`/cook` main-chat turns after a repo had been activated earlier in the same Pi process, so stale canonical stop-wave state can no longer pull unrelated user requests into `completion-regrounder` unless a fresh `/cook` driver prompt is actually in flight

## 0.1.47

### Changed

- removed inline `/cook <text>` argument support so bare `/cook` is now the only supported workflow entrypoint
- made runtime, deterministic regressions, README guidance, and packaged release parity fail closed when command arguments are passed instead of discussion driving proposal derivation
- made bare `/cook` weight the latest clear implementation intent ahead of older background discussion, preserve alternate recent missions for chooser-driven disambiguation, and summarize each candidate directly in the active-workflow chooser instead of forcing a single guessed replacement path
- made bare `/cook` suppress reopening already completed or already verified work by comparing recent discussion against canonical mission, active-slice, and verification-evidence context before startup/refocus proposal confirmation

## 0.1.44

### Fixed

- inject a done-workflow boundary prompt into ordinary primary-agent turns so finished completion state is treated as historical context only and the agent must not resume/reground/refocus the workflow unless the user explicitly reruns `/cook`

## 0.1.43

### Fixed

- stopped injecting completion-workflow reminder and compaction-resume context into ordinary primary-agent turns after canonical `continuation_policy` reaches `done`, so users must rerun `/cook` before the workflow protocol reactivates

## 0.1.42

### Changed

- historically allowed `/cook <hint>` as an analyst-only high-priority prompt that focused proposal derivation without bypassing the existing approval-only Start/Cancel confirmation gate or canonical fail-closed routing; that inline-argument path has since been removed so bare `/cook` is now the only supported entrypoint

## 0.1.41

### Changed

- fixed the `/cook proposal analyst` startup overlay so `Ctrl+C` cancels the in-flight analysis the same way as `Esc`, and updated the helper text to advertise both cancellation paths

## 0.1.40

### Changed

- treated bare `/cook` README/CHANGELOG/docs-only deliverables as concrete repo-change missions instead of preserving generic planning phrasing
- made bare `/cook` ignore assistant/branch/compaction summary artifacts for startup/refocus readiness and fail closed on plan/spec/design-doc/proposal-only context without rewriting canonical state
- refreshed the context-proposal regressions, README guidance, and packaged release parity so the new execution-ready bare `/cook` behavior stays truthful
- internalized the repo-local `pi --no-extensions` isolation inside the packaged verifier scripts so direct `npm run smoke-test`, direct `npm run release-check`, and direct `bash .agent/verify_completion_stop.sh` stay truthful even when `@linimin/pi-letscook` is also installed globally on the same machine

## 0.1.39

### Changed

- aligned public docs and packaged release-gate parity around bare `/cook` as the only supported workflow entrypoint
- updated operator-facing fail-closed guidance to send users back to the main chat to clarify the mission before rerunning bare `/cook`
- refreshed `scripts/release-check.sh` so packaged parity now fails closed on the bare-only contract while still covering the supported startup, refocus, and context flows

## 0.1.38

### Changed

- normalized discussion-derived `/cook` missions through shared proposal finalization so planning-phrased startup, next-round, and bare active-refocus discussions now resolve to implementation-result missions only when scope or acceptance clearly point to shipped code/test/doc/runtime changes
- preserved genuine planning missions for explicit plan/spec/design-doc/migration-plan/proposal and support-docs-only discussions, while keeping ambiguous generic scope fail-closed instead of promoting it into a new mission
- aligned analyst-derived and strict structured-fallback `/cook` proposal paths behind the same mission-normalization rules, added deterministic regressions for planning-only preservation and ambiguous-scope fail-closed behavior, and kept the existing approval-only Start/Cancel rewrite gate intact

## 0.1.37

### Changed

- documented `/cook` as the single public discussion-first workflow command for startup, active-workflow continue/refocus, and done-workflow next-round flows
- reframed the public docs/help copy around `/cook` as the discussion-first workflow entrypoint and documented the conservative fail-closed clarification path before the later runtime removal
- documented the fail-closed ambiguous-discussion behavior and approval-only Start/Cancel gate before canonical-state writes
- added release-gated public-parity assertions for README/help/changelog `/cook` single-command copy so docs drift fails closed before packaging
- simplified the README opening so first-time users can understand the problem `/cook` solves, what the extension provides, and how to start using it without reading the full control-plane details first

## 0.1.35

### Changed

- brightened the remaining `/cook` completion UI helper text by removing the last `dim` styling from proposal intro/footer/scroll hints and running activity metadata, using plain/default text for higher contrast while keeping stalled activity as warning-colored

## 0.1.34

### Changed

- added evaluator calibration fixtures for semantically lenient but well-formed reviewer/auditor/stop-judge reports and made packaged transcription reject those cases fail closed while still accepting truthful passing fixtures
- tightened the reproducible `none; ...` reviewer/auditor/stop-judge bypass checks while still accepting only the exact reviewer `none; proceed to completion-auditor` routing allowance with terminal punctuation or whitespace only
- wired `npm run evaluator-calibration-test` into `npm run release-check` and `.agent/verify_completion_stop.sh` as part of the packaged release gate
- fixed the smoke auto-resume prompt regression so the packaged release check writes `auto-resume-prompt.txt` again and passes on clean HEAD
- promoted `.agent/active-slice.json` to implementation-contract v2 across implementer instructions, fail-closed active-vs-plan parity checks, recovery/reminder surfaces, and a dedicated release-gated regression
- added durable canonical verification evidence at `.agent/verification-evidence.json`, threaded it through docs and recovery surfaces, and made release/stop verification fail closed on missing, stale, wrong-head, or protocol-doc-drift evidence artifacts
- made `/cook` startup and replacement confirmation approval-only by removing inline Edit and mission-anchor editing paths; the proposal gate now offers only Start or Cancel, and cancel points users back to the main chat before rerunning `/cook`
- kept the separate existing-workflow chooser (`Continue current workflow` / `Abandon current workflow and start this new one` / `Cancel`) while updating the replacement path, README, and deterministic context/refocus regressions to match the new approval-only gate truthfully

## 0.1.33

### Changed

- kept full mission text in `/cook` confirmation instead of truncating mission anchors during derivation
- refined `/cook` activity and completion-role text contrast by reducing overuse of `dim` styling in high-value status surfaces

## 0.1.32

### Changed

- made `/cook` auto-continue workflows from canonical state when `continuation_policy == continue`, so the primary driver re-queues the canonical resume prompt after intermediate role turns instead of parking silently on known mandatory steps
- added smoke coverage for the new auto-resume driver prompt behavior and a guarded parked-state warning path to avoid infinite requeue loops on an unchanged mandatory state

## 0.1.31

### Changed

- defined a shared structured evaluation-rubric contract for `completion-reviewer`, `completion-auditor`, and `completion-stop-judge`, including the exact rubric dimensions `Contract coverage`, `Correctness risk`, `Verification evidence`, and `Docs/state parity` with `pass|concern|fail` verdict semantics
- added canonical `task_type: completion-workflow` and `evaluation_profile: completion-rubric-v1` signaling across the packaged control-plane defaults, verifier schema, and kickoff/reminder/resume surfaces
- expanded the exact active-slice implementer handoff with canonical `implementation_surfaces` and `verification_commands` fields, and now surface them alongside `priority` / `why_now` in reminder and compaction-resume text
- documented the rubric-driven evaluation contract plus canonical routing-profile signaling in the packaged completion protocol and README without adding profile-specific rubric-output enforcement yet
- strengthened the smoke/refocus/context regressions so bootstrap and refocus preserve the new canonical signaling and fail closed when required `task_type` / `evaluation_profile` fields are removed
- strengthened the smoke regression and control-plane verifier so selected-slice handoffs now fail closed when the expanded implementation-contract fields are missing
- threaded canonical `evaluation_profile` plus the active-slice implementation contract into reviewer/auditor/stop-judge reminder and dispatch surfaces so those read-only roles can recover from canonical state instead of prose-only summaries
- made reviewer/auditor/stop-judge transcription fail closed on malformed rubric-bearing outputs while still accepting valid reports, and added deterministic transcription coverage for all three roles in `npm run rubric-contract-test`
- kept deterministic `rubric-contract-test` coverage wired into `npm run release-check`
- made the `/cook` confirmation UI critique-aware by rendering critique/risk notes plus recommended `task_type` / `evaluation_profile` routing hints in dedicated sections while keeping the existing Start/Edit/Cancel flow
- persisted accepted startup/refocus routing choices canonically by writing the selected `task_type` / `evaluation_profile` into the canonical control-plane files and recording the accepted critique outcome in continuation state, with `context-proposal-test` and `release-check` covering the shipped flow

## 0.1.30

### Changed

- clarified the README next-round example so the goal text no longer repeats `/cook` in a way that looks like part of the command syntax

## 0.1.29

### Changed

- tightened the README opening description so it correctly presents this package as a Pi extension that adds `/cook`, rather than implying `/cook` is built into Pi itself

## 0.1.28

### Changed

- added model-assisted `/cook` startup proposal analysis for natural recent discussion with a live `/cook proposal analyst` progress overlay, removed the built-in discussion-parser fallback for discussion-only startup, and preserved explicit-goal mission anchoring even when analyst output is unavailable
- replaced the crowded built-in `/cook` startup proposal selector presentation with a custom confirmation UI that separates proposal content from explicit Start, Edit, and Cancel actions
- fixed `/cook proposal analyst` overlay input handling and improved proposal body readability in the confirmation UI

## 0.1.27

### Changed

- added package metadata for npm and pi.dev discovery, fixed README publishing links for npm rendering, and refined install and workflow guidance after the `v0.1.26` tag

## 0.1.26

### Changed

- clarified the README install guidance and `/cook` behavior matrix, including tracked-vs-ignored `.agent` file explanations, active-workflow replacement examples, and safer `/reload` guidance for completion work

## 0.1.25

### Changed

- `/cook` with no goal can now propose a context-derived startup plan for confirmation when no active workflow exists, including starting a fresh next round after the previous workflow already reached `done`
- historically added goal-anchored startup proposals from inline `/cook` arguments before canonical writes, plus more explicit active-workflow replacement wording and direct next-round startup after a completed workflow; that old inline-argument path is no longer supported now that bare `/cook` is the only public entrypoint

## 0.1.24

### Changed

- removed the completion status line entirely; the remaining completion widget appears only when no role is actively running

## 0.1.23

### Changed

- renamed the public workflow command from `/complete` to `/cook`
- aligned the published package/install identity around `@linimin/pi-letscook` and `pi-letscook`
- removed the completion status line entirely; the remaining completion widget now appears only when no role is actively running
- kept the richer live role observability lanes and waiting/stalled signaling without reintroducing a status-line surface
- added this current release entry so the shipped `/cook`, package rename, and current completion UI behavior are documented without rewriting older `/complete` history

## 0.1.22

### Changed

- clarified the existing-workflow continue/refocus selection UI with a clearer prompt, current-vs-proposed mission summary, and shorter option descriptions

## 0.1.21

### Changed

- kept the persistent completion status line from canonical `.agent/**` state and live role activity, while suppressing the widget whenever a role is actively running
- separated live running-role observability into distinct tool activity, role judgment, verification, and state-delta lanes with waiting/stalled signaling
- added deterministic observability status regression coverage to the release-check path
- refreshed README and release-verifier guidance so the shipped observability surfaces and verification flow are documented truthfully

## 0.1.18

### Changed

- reduced the public slash-command surface to a single `/complete` entrypoint
- `/complete` with no goal now resumes from canonical `.agent/**` state when present
- `/complete <new goal>` now asks whether to continue the current mission or refocus canonical mission state before continuing
- removed dedicated resume, reground, panel, history, verify, and pause slash commands in favor of the always-visible workflow status
- pruned helper code that only supported the removed slash commands
- added a regression test for existing-workflow refocus handling and included it in release checks

## 0.1.16

### Improved

- richer operator-facing live role execution display with progress, rationale, next-step, verification, and state-delta parsing
- elapsed-time tracking for running completion roles
- no emoji in workflow-specific status, widget, panel, or role execution displays
- role prompts now emit structured `PROGRESS`, `RATIONALE`, `NEXT`, `VERIFYING`, and `STATE-DELTA` lines for observability

## 0.1.15

### Changed

- removed `/completion-status`; rely on the persistent widget/footer and `/completion-panel` for state inspection

## 0.1.14

### Changed

- removed `/completion-init` and made `/complete <goal>` the single bootstrap-and-run entrypoint
- smoke test now validates bootstrap through `/complete`
- docs updated to treat `/complete` as the canonical initialization path

## 0.1.13

### Improved

- persistent footer/widget status is now more compact and useful for day-to-day workflow use
- always-visible status now surfaces live role/action summaries without requiring the panel to be open
- widget lines now favor concise mission, goal, reason, and live activity previews over verbose raw fields

## 0.1.12

### Improved

- `/completion-panel` now live-follows current running role activity
- side panel and print-mode panel output now include current role, current action, recent activity, and assistant-progress previews while a completion role is running

## 0.1.11

### Added

- `/completion-panel` command for an on-demand right-side completion workflow panel
- live panel view for canonical mission, current phase, active slice, remaining work, and recent history
- print-mode fallback that renders panel contents as plain text when interactive UI is unavailable

## 0.1.10

### Improved

- ambiguous bootstrap goals can now trigger developer confirmation or editing of the proposed `MISSION ANCHOR`
- `/complete` and `/completion-init` keep auto-bootstrap for clear goals but ask before writing weak or underspecified anchors into canonical state
- mission-anchor confirmation uses extension UI instead of relying on model-side clarification later in the workflow

## 0.1.9

### Improved

- bootstrap now derives a cleaner `MISSION ANCHOR` from vague `/complete` and `/completion-init` goals
- weak or underspecified goals now fall back to a stable repo-based mission anchor instead of using raw ambiguous text
- common phrasing noise like `/complete`, `please`, and `end-to-end` is normalized before seeding canonical mission state

## 0.1.8

### Fixed

- removed duplicate prompt-template aliases for `/complete`, `/complete-resume`, and `/completion-status`
- package now exposes those names only as extension commands, avoiding duplicate command entries in pi

## 0.1.7

### Fixed

- generated `verify_completion_control_plane.sh` now validates canonical `plan.json` and `active-slice.json` structure instead of only checking JSON parseability
- exact implementer handoff states now require `priority` and `why_now`, matching the completion protocol docs and role expectations
- scaffolded `active-slice.json` now includes `priority` and `why_now` placeholders to avoid schema drift during later role updates
- `ensureGitignore` now repairs duplicated or drifted completion-protocol ignore blocks instead of bailing out on the first marker match
- smoke test now covers the selected active-slice handoff schema regression and fails closed when `priority`/`why_now` are missing

## 0.1.6

### Fixed

- additional stale-context guards for command handlers and completion role execution
- avoid stale ctx access through cwd, hasUI, ui, and system-prompt lookups after session replacement or reload

## 0.1.5

### Fixed

- stale extension context handling after session replacement or reload
- guarded UI status, widget, theme, and notify calls to avoid stale-ctx runtime errors

## 0.1.4

### Improved

- stronger implementer instructions for roadmap-level drift discovered during implementation
- explicit requirement to hand plan repair back to `completion-regrounder` instead of silently redesigning slices
- implementer report now includes `Plan adjustment required: yes/no - ...`

## 0.1.3

### Improved

- richer live progress visibility for `completion_role`
- current action, recent activity, and assistant-progress previews while roles are running
- less opaque role execution UX during long-running workflow steps

## 0.1.2

### Improved

- stronger post-compaction driver recovery instructions
